# Task 3: Firewall Configuration using firewalld (CentOS Stream 9)

## Objective
To set up and configure a basic firewall on a Linux virtual machine using `firewalld`, the default firewall management tool on CentOS.  
This task is part of the **Cybersecurity Internship** under **The Student Spot Summer Internship ‚Äì May 2025**.

## Steps Performed

1. Installed `firewalld` (pre-installed on CentOS Stream 9).
2. Enabled and started the firewall service.
3. Verified that the firewall was active and running.
4. Set the default zone to `public`.
5. Allowed common services: **SSH**, **HTTP**, and **HTTPS**.
6. Opened a custom port: **8080/tcp**.
7. Verified that all services and ports were correctly added.
8. Removed **HTTP** as a test to practice rule management.
9. Reloaded the firewall and verified changes.

## üîê Commands Used

```bash
# This installs the firewall
sudo dnf install firewalld -y

# Enable and start the firewall service
sudo systemctl enable firewalld
sudo systemctl start firewalld

# Checks the state of the firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --state

# Add commonly used services
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https

# Open a custom port
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp

# Reload to apply changes
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Check all current rules
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

# Remove a service (as practice)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## What I Learned
Before this, I had already explored some basic Linux commands in CentOS, but this task really helped me go deeper into how firewalls actually function. It wasn‚Äôt just about running a few commands ‚Äî I got to understand what each service does, how to control access through ports, and why it matters in securing a system.

Getting hands-on with firewalld gave me a much clearer picture of how firewall rules are structured and applied in real time. Overall, it was a solid opportunity to move beyond theory and really grasp how Linux firewalls help keep systems safe.
