# Task 3: Firewall Configuration using firewalld (CentOS Stream 9)

## Objective
To set up and configure a basic firewall on a Linux virtual machine using `firewalld`, the default firewall management tool on CentOS.  
This task is part of the **Cybersecurity Internship** under **The Student Spot Summer Internship ‚Äì May 2025**.

## Steps Performed

1. Installed `firewalld` (pre-installed on CentOS Stream 9).
2. Enabled and started the firewall service.
3. Verified that the firewall was active and running.
4. Set the default zone to `public`.
5. Allowed common services: **SSH**, **HTTP**, and **HTTPS**.
6. Opened a custom port: **8080/tcp**.
7. Verified that all services and ports were correctly added.
8. Removed **HTTP** as a test to practice rule management.
9. Reloaded the firewall and verified changes.

## üîê Commands Used

```bash
# This installs the firewall
sudo dnf install firewalld -y

# Enable and start the firewall service
sudo systemctl enable firewalld
sudo systemctl start firewalld

# Checks the state of the firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --state

# Add commonly used services
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https

# Open a custom port
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp

# Reload to apply changes
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Check all current rules
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

## What I Learned
This task honestly made me realize how simple but powerful firewall setup can be. I always thought it‚Äôd be super complicated, but using firewalld was actually straightforward once I got the hang of it.

I learned how to allow and block services, open specific ports, and reload changes ‚Äî all through the terminal. It felt good to see those changes reflect immediately. Now I get why this is such an important first step in securing any system.
