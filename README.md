### Task 3: Setting Up UFW Firewall on Ubuntu VM  
Installed and configured Ubuntu Linux on VirtualBox.  
Configured the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to secure the system by setting default policies and enabling firewall rules.  
Learned troubleshooting techniques for VM boot issues and graphics problems.
